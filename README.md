<h1>Backup Ubuntu Server Data</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of an Bash script that performs a data backup of specific data directories on a Ubuntu Linux Server to a backup drive using Rsync.<br/><br/>

<h2>Language</h2>

- <b>Bash</b>
- <b>Rsync</b>
- <b>Cron</b>
- <b>SSMTP</b><br/><br/>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS</b><br/><br/>

<h2>Variables and Settings</h2>

There are several variables that must be changed in the script to suit your needs. The variables that need to be changed are the following:<br/>

- <b>EMAIL_ADDRESS:</b> This is the email address used for backup notifications.<br/>
- <b>SRC_DIR:</b> This is the root directory for the subdirectories that will be backed up.<br/>
- <b>BACKUP_FOLDER_NAMES:</b> This is an array of directories that will be backed up.<br/>
- <b>DEST_BASE_DIR:</b> This is the destination directory for the backup.<br/>

The examples in the ssmtp.conf file are for Gmail. The settings that need to be changed in the ssmtp.conf file are the following:<br/>

- <b>root:</b> This is the email address that gets all mail for userids < 1000. Leave this empty to disable rewriting.<br/>
- <b>mailhub:</b> Fully qualified domain name of the mail server you use, both port 465 or 587 should be acceptable.<br/>
- <b>rewriteDomain:</b> Domain where email is coming form. Set this to the domain of your mail server.<br/>
- <b>hostname:</b> The full hostname.  Must be correctly formed, fully qualified domain name or GMail will reject connection.<br/>
- <b>UseTLS:</b> If your email supports TLS set this to YES. This implies that you are using port 465 or 587.<br/>
- <b>UseSTARTTLS:</b> If you are using port 587 set this to YES. If using port 465 set this to NO.<br/>
- <b>AuthUser:</b> Email account username.<br/>
- <b>AuthPass:</b> Email account password.<br/>
- <b>FromLineOverride:</b> Set this to YES is email users are able to send from their own address. If not, set it to NO.<br/><br/>
